It's completely decentralized, with no central server or trusted parties, because everything is based on crypto proof instead of trust. Give it a try, or take a look at the screenshots and design paper:\n\nDownload Bitcoin v0.1 at http://www.bitcoin.org\n\nThe root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that's required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency, but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust. Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with barely a fraction in reserve. We have to trust them with our privacy, trust them not to let identity thieves drain our accounts. Their massive overhead costs make micropayments impossible.\n\nA generation ago, multi-user time-sharing computer systems had a similar problem. Before strong encryption, users had to rely on password protection to secure their files, placing trust in the system administrator to keep their information private. Privacy could always be overridden by the admin based on his judgment call weighing the principle of privacy against other concerns, or at the behest of his superiors. Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.\n\nIt's time we had the same thing for money. With e-currency based on cryptographic proof, without the need to trust a third party middleman, money can be secure and transactions effortless.\n\nOne of the fundamental building blocks for such a system is digital signatures. A digital coin contains the public key of its owner. To transfer it, the owner signs the coin together with the public key of the next owner. Anyone can check the signatures to verify the chain of ownership. It works well to secure ownership, but leaves one big problem unsolved: double-spending. Any owner could try to re-spend an already spent coin by signing it again to another owner. The usual solution is for a trusted company with a central database to check for double-spending, but that just gets back to the trust model. In its central position, the company can override the users, and the fees needed to support the company make micropayments impractical.\n\nBitcoin's solution is to use a peer-to-peer network to check for double-spending. In a nutshell, the network works like a distributed timestamp server, stamping the first transaction to spend a coin. It takes advantage of the nature of information being easy to spread but hard to stifle. For details on how it works, see the design paper at http://www.bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf\n\nThe result is a distributed system with no single point of failure. Users hold the crypto keys to their own money and transact directly with each other, with the help of the P2P network to check for double-spending.\n\nSatoshi Nakamoto\nhttp://www.bitcoin.org"}, {"author": "Satoshi Nakamoto", "metadata": {"thread_id": 1, "name": "Satoshi Nakamoto", "poster_url": "http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto", "subject": "Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency", "url": "http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/xn/detail/2003008:Comment:9493", "date": "February 15, 2009, 16:42", "post_num": 4, "is_displayed": true, "nested_level": 1, "satoshi_id": 2}, "authorText": "Could be.

They are issued in a limited, predetermined amount.\n\nAs an example, if there are 1000 nodes, and 6 get coins each hour, it would likely take a week before you get anything.\n\nTo Sepp's question, indeed there is nobody to act as central bank or federal reserve to adjust the money supply as the population of users grows. That would have required a trusted party to determine the value, because I don't know a way for software to know the real world value of things. If there was some clever way, or if we wanted to trust someone to actively manage the money supply to peg it to something, the rules could have been programmed for that.\n\nIn this sense, it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value."}, {"author": "Satoshi Nakamoto", "metadata": {"thread_id": 1, "name": "Satoshi Nakamoto", "poster_url": "http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/profile/SatoshiNakamoto", "subject": "Bitcoin open source implementation of P2P currency", "url": "http://p2pfoundation.ning.com/xn/detail/2003008:Comment:52186", "date": "March 7, 2014, 1:17", "post_num": 14, "is_displayed": true, "nested_level": 0, "satoshi_id": 4}, "authorText": "I am not Dorian Nakamoto."}, {"author": "Satoshi Nakamoto", "metadata": {"thread_id": 2, "name": "satoshi", "poster_url": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3", "subject": "Welcome to the new Bitcoin forum!", "url": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=5.msg28#msg28", "date": "November 22, 2009, 06:04:28 PM", "post_num": 1, "is_displayed": true, "nested_level": 0, "satoshi_id": 5}, "authorText": "Welcome to the new Bitcoin forum!The old forum can still be reached here:http://bitcoin.sourceforge.net/boards/index.phpI'll repost some selected threads here and add updated answers to questions where I can.FAQhttp://bitcoin.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php?page=FAQDownloadhttp://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/"}, {"author": "Satoshi Nakamoto", "metadata": {"thread_id": 3, "name": "satoshi", "poster_url": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3", "subject": "Repost: Bitcoin Maturation", "url": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=6.msg29#msg29", "date": "November 22, 2009, 06:31:44 PM", "post_num": 1, "is_displayed": true, "nested_level": 0, "satoshi_id": 6}, "authorText": "--------------------bitcoinbitcoin:Bitcoin MaturationPosted:Thu 01 of Oct, 2009 (14:12 UTC)From the user's perspective the bitcoin maturation process can be broken down into 8 stages.1.

It is far too easy for ISPs to portscan clients and detect they are running this program.That's a good idea. \u00a0The side accepting the connection just needs to withhold from sending anything until it receives a valid handshake. \u00a0Any portscan would only get a dead connection that doesn't volunteer to identify itself. Quote- Use some sort of encryption during the handshake (sort of goes with the statement/request above) to obfuscate what the software is during DPI (deep packet inspection). I am really thinking about people in non-free (as in freedom) countries such as China/Iran.I have thought about eventually SSLing all the connections. \u00a0I assume anything short of SSL would be pointless against DPI. \u00a0Maybe a better more immediate solution is to connect through TOR, which will be possible with 0.2. \u00a0Quote- Some sort of an API is needed so that this system can be integrated with websites to provide instant-on services. A simple https receipt mechanism would do wonders. Have the client post each incoming payment to an https url with all of the relevant information and provide status updates. Also an outbound payment mechanism would be nice. So one could automate payments (and batch payments) outbound. Status could be returned via the https receipt interface.That's one of the main things on the agenda after 0.2.Quote- Static port/Random port. Have a setting to randomly assign the port that it runs on. (also be able to set it statically for very restrictive firewalls).Yeah, the other stealth stuff would be kinda pointless if it's always the same port number.Quote- UPnP support. Have the client automatically create the port forward on upstream routers. Enabled by default. Can be turned off in the options menu.I'm looking forward to trying UPnP. \u00a0Do most P2P clients typically have UPnP enabled by default?Quote- Ability to compile a headless (console only) install for *NIX systems. Also have the ability to just run as a network service. Perhaps with a telnet-able port for control (or even a unix socket would be ok).I'm still thinking about how best to structure the management interface. \u00a0Maybe command line commands to communicate with the background daemon to query transactions received and initiate sending transfers. \u00a0That would be more automation friendly. \u00a0Or what about an http interface on some port other than 80 to manage it with a browser?"}, {"author": "Satoshi Nakamoto", "metadata": {"thread_id": 8, "name": "satoshi", "poster_url": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?action=profile;u=3", "subject": "Re: A few suggestions", "url": "https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=12.msg45#msg45", "date": "December 10, 2009, 07:31:49 PM", "post_num": 5, "is_displayed": true, "nested_level": 0, "satoshi_id": 16}, "authorText": "Quote from: madhatter2 on December 10, 2009, 02:00:17 PMFront ends can also be ran on clients with very low cpu power such as mobile phones.

(Just an example).I see, that would happen with multiple nodes using the same NAT or VPN or some ISP that funnels everyone through a few proxy servers. \u00a0I just committed a fix to SVN for this. \u00a0If it gets \"433\" name already in use (it was error 433, right?), it'll retry with a non-address random username. \u00a0QuoteIn any event, I would like to help.

0.01? \u00a0It would be awfully annoying to ask each time. \u00a0If you have 50.00 and send 10.00, the recipient would get 10.00 and you'd have 39.99 left. \u00a0I think it should just add it

size.\u00a0 The bulk of their data is hashes and keys and signatures, which are uncompressible.\u00a0 The serialization overhead is very small, usually 1 byte for size fields.On Gavin's idea about an existing P2P broadcast infrastructure, I doubt one exists.\u00a0 There are few P2P systems that only need broadcast.\u00a0 There are some libraries like Chord that try to provide a distributed hash

The seller receives a transaction with the money in escrow, but he can't spend it until the buyer unlocks it. The buyer can release the payment at any time after that, which could be never. This does not allow the buyer to take the money back, but it does give him the option to burn the money out of spite by never releasing it. The seller has the option to release the money back to the buyer.While this system does not guarantee the parties against loss, it takes the profit out of cheating.If the seller doesn't send the goods, he doesn't get paid. The buyer would still be out the money, but at least the seller has no monetary motivation to stiff him.The buyer can't benefit by failing to pay. He can't get the escrow money back. He can't fail to pay due to lack of funds. The seller can see that the funds are committed to his key and can't be sent to anyone else.Now, an economist would say that a fraudulent seller could start negotiating, such as \"release the money and I'll give you half of it back\", but at that point, there would be so little trust and so much spite that negotiation is unlikely. Why on earth would the fraudster keep his word and send you half if he's already breaking his word to steal it?

\u00a0It's also convenient that server farms can run a single Bitcoin node and the rest only run getwork clients.The interface has a few changes:getwork [data]If [data] is not specified, returns formatted hash data to work on:\u00a0\u00a0\"midstate\" : precomputed hash state after hashing the first half of the data\u00a0\u00a0\"data\" : block data\u00a0\u00a0\"hash1\" : formatted hash buffer for second hash\u00a0\u00a0\"target\" : little endian hash targetIf [data] is specified, tries to solve the block and returns true if it was successful. \u00a0[data] is the same 128 byte block data that was returned in the \"data\" field, but with the nonce changed.Notes: - It does not return work when you submit a possible hit, only when called without parameter.- The block field has been separated into data and hash1.- data is 128 bytes, which includes the first half that's already hashed by midstate.- hash1 is always the same, but included for convenience.- Logging of \"ThreadRPCServer method=getwork\" is disabled, it would be too much junk in the log."}, {"author": "Satoshi Nakamoto", "metadata": {"thread_id": 246, "name": "satoshi", "poster_url":

byte-reversed, and in what way.getwork does the byte-reversing. \u00a0midstate, data and hash1 are already big-endian, and you pass data back still big-endian, so you work in big-endian and don't have to do any byte-reversing. \u00a0They're the same data that is passed to the ScanHash_ functions. \u00a0You can take midstate, data and hash1, put them in 16-byte aligned buffers and pass them to a ScanHash_ function, like ScanHash(pmidstate, pdata + 64, phash1, nHashesDone). \u00a0If a nonce is found, patch it into data and call getwork.I should probably change the ScanHash_ functions to use pdata instead of pdata + 64 so they're consistent.target is little endian, it's supposed to be the same as how m0mchil's did it. \u00a0(if it's not, then it should be fixed) \u00a0That's the only case

be easy to double-count transactions when they get confirmed again.3) A transaction can be replaced by a double-spend with a different txid. \u00a0You would count both spends.The model where you assume you only need to see new transactions because you've already seen previous transactions is not true. \u00a0Old transactions can change at any time.Any time you take an action based on payment amounts received, you always need to go back to bitcoin and ask for a current balance total (or use move or sendfrom), and be ready for the possibility that it can go down.Now that we have the Accounts feature making it easier to do it the right way, we're better prepared to have listtransactions."}, {"author": "Satoshi Nakamoto", "metadata": {"thread_id": 253, "name": "satoshi",

When there's a block-chain reorg, it would be easy to double-count transactions when they get confirmed again.The OP's example of listtransactions <account> [count=10] [txid] seems to imply and it would be very easy for programmers to assume that if they pass in the last txid of the previous call to listtransactions, they will never see the same transaction more than once, which is not the case. \u00a0It would be very easy to double-count payments if you don't maintain your own persistent map or dictionary to track which txid's you've already accepted.It doesn't seem right to have a function that seems tailor made to be used a certain obvious way, and that way is a non-obvious trap.Quote from: jgarzik on December 08, 2010, 11:07:22 PMQuote from: satoshi on December 08, 2010,
